    "body": "> [!CAUTION]  \r\n>  **The upcoming v7 release of Snipe-IT will require PHP 8.1 or greater**\r\n\r\nHappy Friday! Lots of fixes and improvements in this version. Here's the tldr;, with the full changelog below:\r\n\r\n- Added Somali translation\r\n- Fixed several label setting glitches\r\n- Fixed some API scoping issues where results were not as constrained as they should have been when searching\r\n- Added column selectors and signatures to the \"print all assigned\" page\r\n- Added 2FA reset logging (this shows up as a separate action, not a normal user edit)\r\n- Added AVIF as an accepted image format\r\n- Added ability to \"toggle all\" columns in the list views on most pages\r\n- Added the ability to \"deep link\" to search results in those list views\r\n- Updated the documentation to reflect that the [php exif](https://www.php.net/manual/en/exif.setup.php) library is required\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]  \r\n>  **Upcoming Breaking API change!** In between the last release and this one, we also discovered that a change we made midway through releases broke the [Jamf2Snipe](https://github.com/grokability/jamf2snipe) integration for adding/updating assets. We had changed the \"shape\" of the asset response to be more consistent with how we present that JSON in other API responses - however in doing so, we broke some of the Jamf2Snipe capabilities. We've reverted that change for now, but in the next release, we'll be adding that change back *and* updating the Jamf2Snipe library to match that capability. \r\n\r\nWe *are* noticing in some of the translations in CrowdIn that some `trans_choice()` translations are showing with a weird `<unk>` symbol instead of the pipe (`|`) symbol that the translations strings need in order to decide whether or not to pluralize a string. We've been fixing them as we find them, but if you see anything unusual, open an issue here or [propose the change in our CrowdIn project](https://crowdin.com/project/snipe-it).\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Updated language strings, added Somali by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14400\r\n* Fixed uninitialized string offset error in labels in new label engine when field label was blank by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14404\r\n* Fixed `checkout_date` for licenses on print all assigned for users by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14407\r\n* Fixed deprecation warning on `strtoupper()` by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14413\r\n* Fixed requestable search API scoping by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14430\r\n* Removes the unused `mediconesystems/livewire-datatables` package by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14427\r\n* Fixed z-index of date-picker by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14415\r\n* Fix [sc-25008] -
